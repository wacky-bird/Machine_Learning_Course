# README

This is the 3rd assignment for the Machine Learning course offered by [||Source||](https://github.com/llSourcell).
This assignment was based off of the [IEEE-CIS KAGGLE competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ieee-fraud-detection) looking into fraud detection.

Below is a plot showing the metrics results of the six algorithms use:

* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree Classifer
* Ada Boosting Classifier
* Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier
* Gradient Boosting Classifier
* Random Forest Classifier
